COMP 127 HW 4:  Breakout!
==========================

For this homework assignment, I wrote a program to play the classic arcade game of Breakout. In Breakout, your goal is to clear a collection of bricks by hitting each of them with a bouncing ball.

Breakout was developed in 1976 by Steve Wozniak, shortly before he cofounded Apple Computer, Inc. He [cited the experience of building the game](https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up) as part of his inspiration in creating the Apple ][, the first commercially viable home computer.
